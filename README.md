# **UFOs**

## Overview
Through this challenge we have created a webpage with a dynamic table with information about UFO sightings across the world. We created filters for our table to prvide a customized experience for each user to be able to explore UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and even the shape of the sighting.

## Results
Imagine someone comes across our webpage and is interested in learning if there have been any similar UFO sightings to ones they have heard about in their area. Our filter search criteria gives the user complete control in selecting only the data they are interested in seeing. They grew up in California, and had always heard rumors of bright red lights in the sky. So they filter by State, "CA", and filter by Shape, "light".

Our dynamic table displays only the data that meets the values the user has input. Our table also has more details, such as the duration of the sightings and comments that explain more about the sighting. Our user sees that there were 5 different sightings of red lights throughout the state in 2010!

## Summary
Any user interested in our UFO data could use our site to quickly filter and find what they're looking for. However there are some drawbacks and imrovements that can be made.
One drawback with how our site is currently operating is you can only search one value for each keyword at a time. What if we were interested in sightings across the west coast and wanted to view California, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington? We would have to look up each state at a time. 
This is also a possible way to further develop the site and make improvements. A cool feature would be adding in a map that displays the locations of the sightings, and being able to lookup multiple states at once, you could view an even larger portion of the map. The details from the Duration and Comments columns could also be added in tags that open when you hover over the sighting. However, there are improvements needed with the Duration and Comments data. The duration lengths need to be standardized, some say "about 15 minutes", some "5-6 minutes" and others like "10:00". The Comments also need to be reviewed, there are a few with syntax errors that are not displaying properly in the table.
